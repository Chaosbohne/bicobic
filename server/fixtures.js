I have written a lot of funny apps in meteor, but how it scales/works in production-mode. Have you done correct input validation, right publication/subscription handling and does unexpected problems occur ? These are just a few things that all have to work hand in hand. Further i never hosted a meteor-app and it is time to try it out.\n\n 2. **Hosting**\n\n  Well never hosting a meteor-app is an understatement. If you want an app in production-mode you have to deploy it on a server. I have never done this as well. Deploying on meteor.com is quite easy but how easy is it with other \"real\" hosters.  Which hosters are there, how do they work and what does it cost? Is hosting with meteorite as easy as with meteor?\n\n 3. **Buying a domain**\n\n  I also never buyed a domain and these things should be done to get more experience. What can go wrong, how long does it take, what does it cost. These are all questions i need to find out!\n\n 4. **Git**\n\n  Everything and everbody uses git. I am not completely familiar with all these github commands. I dont even know a meteorite module or a npm module that is not published there. I want to publish some of my projects aswell but at first i have to learn more about.\n\n 5. **Sharing**\n\n  I am using meteor quite a long time and i learn everyday something new. But sometimes there are problems that have to be discussed. Whats the best way to integrate google maps or something like disqus. Further i want to do a small tutorial, maybe on the base of my blog.\n\n\n 6. **Showing**\n\n  Last month i had four talks with software companies and no one heard about meteor nor they were able to understand or to follow me when i was talking about meteor. Hopefully i can get them to dig deeper when i link them to my blog.\n\n 7. **Studying**\n\n  Yes i want to learn more about meteor. The api is changing frequently. Maybe i should create a meetup here in Dresden, Germany.\n\n 8. **Feedback**\n\n  Often things can be done easier and better as you might expect. If some of you read my posts improve and brainstorm them.\n\n 9. **Improving my English**\n\n  One key reason is to improve my English. Everything has to be done in English in the way that everybody can understand. I just speak and write an easy form of this language so this is an exercise for me to get practice.\n\n 10. **Self promotion**\n\n  The more and more you represent yourself with projects you have done. If i get all these 9 steps above done this should be a good base. Despite it sound pretty cool when i say: \"Check out my blog\" :)\n\n\n\nMaybe some of these reasons are things you want to know aswell and my first blogposts will treat these steps.

These web-apps have to be fast, reactive and always accessible. In my opinion the IDE should be the same. An IDE as an web-app should work in every browser, everywhere at every time. What advantages/disadvantages has an online IDE?\n\n**Advantages**  \n\n   - use your sourcecode everywhere  \n   - using different devices different browsers  \n   - no installations required  \n   - IDEs working quite well  \n   - they have free utilization\n                     \nWell a couple of you would say \"I transport everything on my laptop\" but it does not give you all the functionality a online IDE has. A laptop can break and your data is lost. If you switch to another device you have to configure everything from begin. Online you can push your code to github, manage it and you even have a versionhistory. Despite i dont even have a laptop. I know this is oldschool, but there are desktops everywhere. At university, at home or by my friends. I think it is easy to understand carrying USB-Sticks from A to B, doing backups and synchronzing changes is no work someone likely does.
